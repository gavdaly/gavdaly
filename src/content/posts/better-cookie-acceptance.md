right now there’s a black pattern for using cookies cause they want you to accept the cookies many websites right now pop up this huge pop up that blocks everything especially on mobile and we have to do is you have to click except or you have to go through multiple steps to disable or not allow cookies, or select which cookies you want this is a horrible pattern that it’s taken in shape.

TODO! add an image of cookie acceptance.

A slight improvement over this would be to have a bonus is except and another button if there’s touch to slide to deny. This will make it much easier and much more user-friendly and take up a lot less space than the current situation we have now that’s just a cluster fuck.

TODO! Add an image of improved situation

The best way to do it personally would be to have a pop-up, not even a pop-up a slide in come in and have accept and deny, and then after 30 seconds and automatically denies and the sliding goes away.

TODO! Add a animated gif of cookie acceptance.

I think that should be the new industry standard and people should stop torturing their users and make it easy for them to make the choices that we all want.

Or you could do even better and just not use third-party cookies or cookies that track people and our predatory and fuck up their personal data and track them all over the web.
