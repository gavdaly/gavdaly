## Headless Branches and Improving GIT?

I watched a video on YouTube about a cool new tool called `jj` that allows you to create headless branches in Git. I thought it was a cool idea, so I decided to give it a try. It was a problem to push changes to the remote repository. So I put it on the back burner. Tried some of the other apps that are supposed to make Git easier to use. But I alwasys had branching problems.

Then heard on the changelog podcast about GitButler. I decided to give it a try. I'm Lovin' It!

## Easily make pull requests and integrate to GitHub.

On personal projects I'd normally just push to the master branch. But now I can easily create a branch and push to it. Then create a pull request to merge the changes. It's so easy!

## Easily move files to different branches.

## Add files and re-push to the remote repository.
