**Living healthy** is hard, espically in today with all of the redialy available carbohydrates.

### Eating Healthy

Eat whole foods, don't eat too many calories, and eat enough protein. This is the best way to eat healthy. The more you can cook your own food, the better.

### Walkin', Ruckin' and Rowin'

These are the excercises that I do. Walking is super important, it helps relax your body and, it's a form of meditation.

### Drink Lots of Water

I drink lots of water, aim for at least 1 gallon (4 liters) a day. I have a gallon water bottle I carry around everywhere.

### Sleep

Sleep is the most important thing you can do for your health. It is the time when your body repairs itself. Make sure you get enough sleep every night.

## The Outcome

I have so much more energy and have a much clearer head. No more brain fog and less brain farts.
