## Algorithms

### Curve25519 (Asymetric, ECC)

### NIST P-256/P-384/P-521 (ECC)

### Lattice-based cryptography (Post-Quantum)

### Multivariate cryptography (Post-Quantum)

The strength of these algorithms depends on proper key sizes and implementation. RSA and ECC are most widely used, while post-quantum algorithms are being developed to resist quantum computer attacks.

### AES - Advanced Encryption Standard (Symetric)

128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit key sizes
GCM and CBC modes recommended

### ChaCha20 (Symetric)

Paired with Poly1305 for authenticated encryption

### Serpent (Symetric)

128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit key sizes

### Twofish (Symetric)

128-bit, 192-bit, 256-bit key sizes
