There's nothing fancy about AI it's math, it will give you the same answer every time if there isn't a random component added.

When you think of the Model as a set of information it is going to give you the average.

If you ask for a blog article it's going to give you a average response. Which you probably don't want. You want personality and emotion.

When you ask for code it's going to give you average public code. Lots of the code use was tutorials and examples that are old. So you are going to get average tutorial and example results! Want to run a business on that?

I find LLMs accelerate and greatly help when filling in an outline. Adding boilerplate. Start the brain storming process. And summarizing text.

Don't think you can summarize text and understand what was said or the nuance.

talking out an article together.
