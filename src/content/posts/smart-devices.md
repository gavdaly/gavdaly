Having a device connected doesn’t necessarily mean it’s smart. It’s a common misconception that if something can be controlled remotely or via an app, it has advanced intelligence. But, truly measure of a _"smart"_ device it's about the ability to make decisions and provide value autonomously and not being a glorified light switch.

Let’s consider a bathroom exhaust fan, for example. You might think that being able to turn it on and off from your phone via the internet makes it smart. It’s a nice convenience, sure, but the real _smart_ technology lies in its ability to operate in response to real-world data without your input.

Imagine an exhaust fan that detects rising humidity levels after a shower and turns itself on to prevent mold, or one that activates when it senses an increase in carbon monoxide, enhancing both comfort and safety. Now _that’s_ smart and actually useful. The fan isn’t just passively waiting for a command from you. It’s working autonomously without your input, contributing to your environment’s health, wellbeing and nicer smelling bathroom.

In essence, being smart isn't about being connected to the internet. It is about being aware of the surroundings and taking action to improve them. True _smart_ devices operate with intelligent responses to changes in their environment, often enhancing our lives in ways that a simple switch never could.

Using automation in our homes brings new opportunities for how we think about technology. Connectivity is important, but the future of smart homes lies in devices that can act independently to make our daily routines healthier and more efficient.

A truly smart home is one where technology takes care of the details, letting you focus on living life to the fullest. It should not be a hassle it should make your life healthier, easier and more comfortable.
