## Editor & Terminal

- **Font**: `Monaspace Argon`,
- **Theme**: `Catppuccin Frapp√©`
- **Editor**: I've started to use [Zed](https://zed.dev/) in the summer of 2024. It's a new editor that's fast, has AI build in and has minimal plugins. I've found that not having all of the plugins that I had in VSCode has made me more productive.
- **Terminal**: I just started using [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) the day it was released publicly. My favourite feature of Ghostty right now it having no chrome.
- **Dotfiles**: _Comming soon_
