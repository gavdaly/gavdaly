**Living healthy** is hard, especially today with all of the readily available carbohydrates. I have struggled for many years trying to keep my weight down. I've tried many diets and exercise programs. I've found there is no magic solution. Here is what has worked for me, I hope it can help you.

### Eating Healthy

Eat whole foods, don't eat too many calories, and eat enough protein. The more you can cook your own food, the better.

### Walkin', Ruckin' and Rowin'

These are the exercises that I do. Walking is super important; it helps relax your body and it's a form of meditation. Rucking is simply walking with a weighted backpack. And rowing is a great full body workout that really gets your heart rate up. I do this in a high intensity style.

### Drink Lots of Water

I drink lots of water; aim for at least 1 gallon (4 liters) a day. I have a gallon water bottle I carry around everywhere. When I'm feeling extra thirsty or hungry when I think I shouldn't be, I'll have some electrolytes. It normally helps.

### Sleep

Sleep is the most important thing you can do for your health. It is the time when your body repairs itself. Make sure you get enough sleep every night.

## The Outcome

I have so much more energy and have a much clearer head. No more brain fog, less brain farts. I hope this helps.
