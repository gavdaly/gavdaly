## Development Environment

You can spin up a ready-to-code workspace using the included Dev Container configuration. It installs Node 23.5.0, pnpm, npm, and Cloudflare Wrangler so the usual `npm` scripts and Pages workflows run out of the box.

1. Install the [VS Code Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) or use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
2. Open this repository and choose **Reopen in Container**.
3. After the container builds, dependencies install automatically (`postCreateCommand`).

The container forwards port `4321` for the Astro dev server and `8787` for Wrangler previews.
